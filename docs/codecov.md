## Codecoverage - why and what is it?


Code coverage is a metric that can help you understand how much of your source is tested. Its sometimes good and in some cases not. <br>
It's better to have codecov than to not have that.

Everything you can see in docs about how it works https://docs.codecov.com/docs

###TLDR 
To make it work in your custom repository you only need to add github secret called `CODECOV_TOKEN`
